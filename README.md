# 2D-image-classification-algorithm
The purpose of this project is to strengthen the understanding of the working principle of Transformer architecture and its derivation and application in the CV domain, and at the same time, to accumulate the related technical practical experience.

## DataSet: Animals-10 ( available at kaggle.com )
First, one-fifth of the original dataset is used as the test dataset. Then, the remaining part of the data is divided into training and validation datasets in a ratio of 4:1.

## Models:
1. ResNet
2. Vision Transformer
3. Swin Transformer

## Description of files:
1. Files such as "XXXXX_train.py" are executable files that are used to train the corresponding models.
2. Files such as "XXXXX_test.py" are executable files that are used to evaluate the corresponding models on test dataset.
3. File "compare_model.py" is used to evaluate FPS and volume of each model.
